# Abstract 
The goal of the project is to perform imaging with a lensless camera known as DiffuserCam (https://medium.com/@bezzam/lensless-imaging-with-the-raspberry-pi-and-python-diffusercam-473e47662857). A more rudimentary version of the DiffuserCam was used, where we used a piece of tape instead of
the lens and the Raspberry Pi HQ camera sensor. Various computational algorithms to solve inverse problems were used and different regularizations were tested depending on the prioir beliefs to perform image reconstruction. We use the python library Pycsou (https://matthieumeo.github.io/pycsou/html/index.html) for solving linear inverse problems.
